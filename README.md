# Deep Learning in Galaxy Morphology

Classification of galaxies and identification of features methodically performed using Convolutional Neural Net. 
Under the Guidance of Dr. Ajit Kembhavi, former Director, Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and Dr Sheelu Abraham (IUCAA) (2017 December)

## Getting Started

The code is written in Python and implements libraries such as Keras, Matplotlib, Numpy, 

### Prerequisites

Installation of Keras. 

```
 pip install keras
```


## Running the tests

 CNN folder is used for classifying galaxies into Elliptical and Spiral galaxies.

 CNNBar folder is used for classifying spiral galaxies into Barred and Unbarred galaxies.
 

## Built With

python
keras
tensorflow
